// Q4  Explain the use of a stack in recursion
//Recursive functions use something called “the call stack.” When a program calls a function, that function goes on top of the call stack. This similar to a stack of books. You add things 
//one at a time. Then, when you are ready to take something off, you always take off the top item.
