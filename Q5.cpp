// Q5  Which is generally more efficient, recursion or iteration?

//A program is called recursive when an entity calls itself. A program is call iterative when there is a loop (or repetition).

//Usage: Usage of either of these techniques is a trade-off between time complexity and size of code. If time complexity is the point of focus, and number of recursive calls would be 
//large, it is better to use iteration. However, if time complexity is not an issue and shortness of code is, recursion would be the way to go.
